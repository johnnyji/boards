  Views are comprised on render functions that take in a view name, and
  a map of attributes to render (called by the controller originally as a keyword list).

  The `render` functions of views will each return a map which will be the data transformed
  into JSON and sent over to our front-end

  Since we've already specified the fields to serialize from the User struct in
  user.ex, we can just return the user as a normal map without having to use the
  `render_one` or `render_many` options
